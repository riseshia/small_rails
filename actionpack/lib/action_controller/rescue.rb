module ActionController #:nodoc:
  # Actions that fail to perform as expected throw exceptions. These exceptions can either be rescued for the public view
  # (with a nice user-friendly explanation) or for the developers view (with tons of debugging information). The developers view
  # is already implemented by the Action Controller, but the public view should be tailored to your specific application. So too
  # could the decision on whether something is a public or a developer request.
  #
  # You can tailor the rescuing behavior and appearance by overwriting the following two stub methods.
